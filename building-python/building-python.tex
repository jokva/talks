    \begin{itemize}
        \item Introduce me and my team
        \item Python is pretty good at high-level problem description
        \item We still want to do the heavy lifting in C++
        \item Good examples are tensorflow, scikit-learn, numpy
        \item Our colleagues use python, and want us to provide ready-to-use
              packages
        \item Then you need to \emph{build} then, and we have made some painful
              experiences with that
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Kinds of Python}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pure python
        \item Impure Python (non-python code behind CPython API)
        \item Thin library wrappers
        \item Fat library wrappers
    \end{itemize}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Pure python is what we want out downstream users to do
            \item Impure python is almost indistinguishable from pure python:
                  Numpy and chunks of the python standard library are good
                  examples.
            \item Thin wrappers rely on some system provided library and
                  provide an entry point from Python. Fire, wait, and parse the
                  output
            \item Rely on larger,  but do more than just provide an entry point
                  - sophisticated I/O, manipulation of state, and rich access
                  to library functionality. Difference between this and impure
                  python is that numpy's backend is only available in python,
                  contrary to say python-BLAS
        \end{itemize}
        We'll focus on impure and fat library.

    \begin{description}
        \item [Late 90s] Python wanted something like CPAN
        \item [2000] Distutils released for Python 1.6 standard library
        \item [2003] PyPI is online, distutils can create package metadata
        \item [2008] Setuptools extends and supersedes distutils, pip builds on it
    \end{description}

    \note{
        \emph{Read the list}: standard library is where modules go to die
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Setup written for distutils generally work with setuptools,
                  strong backwards compatibility. This also means a lot of
                  legacy
            \item Distutils came with infrastructure for building C code, a
                  uses homegrown compiler abstraction
            \item Assumes the same compiler that built Python is available
            \item This is terrible on Windows where dealing with compilers is a
                  pain
            \item No custom options really, stuck on the configuration
                  setuptools already has
            \item Building pollutes source tree
            \item Let's start building a package

            \item This is for a pure python package
            \item It's quite minimal, setuptools support a wide range of keys
                  and metadata. It can figure some things out, since our
                  project is \emph{standard layout}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This now fails on gcc < 6.0, because C++98 was still the
                  default

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ok good, so this builds... on linux
            \item MSVC doesn't understand this flag
            \item So now our script needs to detect compiler and only set the
                  flag on gcc
            \item ... until we also want to build with clang
            \item If you've ever built C++ for multiple platforms or even
                  different computers you see how this can get problematic fast
            \item It's quite hard to ad-hoc configure on new systems

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This is a snippet from our project segyio
            \item setuptools actually \emph{crashed} on being given
                  --library-dirs
            \item Ok, so maybe not pass it when you're sitting on windows, but
                  what about when this is in scripts
            \item Honestly, setup.py-files that do more than setup() and are
                  pure python tend to be low-effort, buggy, \emph{works on my
                  machine} solutions

            \item And feel like this

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Building native code}
    The struggle of binary libraries

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiple compilers with different flags
        \item Compiler versions
        \item Multiple available compilers
        \item Platform-specific options
        \item Configuration-specific options, e.g. \verb|USE_BLAS|
        \item Feature detection
        \item Build and runtime dependencies
        \item Binary compatibility
    \end{itemize}

    \note{
        \emph{Read list}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The experience compiling and developing native extensions is
                  terrible
            \item Setuptools has virtually nothing to help you here, boils down
                  to manually implementing half of cmake
            \item The development story is quite bad too
            \item People end up hard-coding links to /opt/local/lib64, I can't
                  blame them
            \item Since setup.py implements build, install, test commands,
                  custom option commands are difficult or clumsy
        \end{itemize}
    }
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Developing native code}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Changes in headers aren't detected, and the module isn't
              recompiled - not great with templates
        \item Designed for distribution, not development
        \item Setuptools assumes it controls the world, so it pollutes source
              trees. Not cool when python support is a sub project
    \end{itemize}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Overall, setuptools does a poor job of tracking file ->
                  compiled object dependencies
            \item Not designing for live development of C based modules is
                  fine, they weren't aiming to build a C build system. But most
                  time is spent is development (by me), and having parallel
                  development and build systems suck

    \end{displayquote}
    - scikit-build readme

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Briefly, it automates building C++ with cmake, and automates
                  dealing with python flags, layout, options.
            \item It adresses most of the shortcomings with setuptools for
                  extensions
            \item For distribution: feature autodiscovery, compiler config,
                  dependency configuration etc
            \item For development: easy debug/release builds, file-object
                  dependency tracking, incremental builds
            \item Setuptools does what setuptools can (build python), cmake

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Hate it or love it, cmake is pretty good at what it does
            \item It's reasonably easy to set options, deal with compiler
                  differences in cmake
            \item When you have third-party dependencies that provide
                  cmake-config or similar, you can easily get them from inside
                  the python extension with find-package

        \begin{itemize}
            \item An ABI tag helps pip select the right package
            \item pip resolves these names from the host system
            \item Notice the tag says linux. Not well suited for distribution
                  because users might have older libc
            \item For good binaries we need the manylinux tag
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize}

            \item The manylinux image is specified by the PyPA, basically the
                  oldest libc + supporting libs they could use (RHEL5)
            \item Windows packages built on Windows, linux on RHEL5 etc.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item A machine definition would be perfect for obsolete systems
                  like RHEL5 and Windows
            \item Multiple machine definitions means we can test on multiple
                  systems
            \item With triggers, they can now run on every PR and every HEAD
                  pushed
            \item A new release can also be a trigger
            \item Makes it easier for contributers too, they don't have to set
                  up a complicated rig to run the new changes on multiple
                  systems

        \begin{itemize}

                  uploads the freshly-built wheels
            \item This means the released archives are never built on developer
                  machines
            \item And we have a one-click deploy feature in place
            \item It's great for velocity, and it means \emph{any} team member
                  can deploy new releases
