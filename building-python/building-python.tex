\begin{frame}{Types of Python}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pure python
        \item Impure Python (non-python code behind CPython API)
        \item Thin library wrappers
        \item Fat library wrappers
    \end{itemize}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Pure python is what we want out downstream users to do
            \item Impure python is almost indistinguishable from pure python:
                  Numpy and chunks of the python standard library are good
                  examples.
            \item Thin wrappers rely on some system provided library and
                  provide an entry point from Python. Ctypes is often use for
                  this - fire, wait, and parse the output
            \item Rely on larger, often system-wide external libraries, but do
                  more than just provide an entry point - sophisticated I/O,
                  manipulation of state, and rich access to library
                  functionality. Difference between this and impure python is
                  that numpy's backend is only available in python, contrary to
                  say python-BLAS
        \end{itemize}
        We'll focus on impure and fat library.

\begin{frame}{Some history}
    \begin{description}
        \item [Late 90s] Python wanted something like CPAN
        \item [2000] Distutils released for Python 1.6 standard library
        \item [2003] PyPI is online, distutils can create package metadata
        \item [2008] Setuptools extends and supersedes distutils, pip builds on it
    \end{description}

    \note{
        \emph{Read the list}: standard library is where modules go to die
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notice \emph{everything builds on}
            \item Setup written for distutils generally work with setuptools,
                  strong backwards compatibility. This also means a lot of
                  legacy
            \item Distutils came with infrastructure for building C code
            \item Feels much intended for building Python extensions, using the
                  same compiler that built Python.
            \item This is terrible on Windows where dealing with compilers is a
                  pain
            \item Uses homegrown compiler abstraction and option dispatch
                  interface. No robust feature discovery, a C build-system but
                  not really
            \item Building pollutes source tree
            \item Let's start building a package
        \end{itemize}
    }

    \lstinputlisting{my-package/setuptools-pure.py}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This is for a pure python package
            \item It's quite minimal, setuptools support a wide range of keys
                  and metadata. It can figure some things out, since our
                  project is "standard layout".
            \item Let's add some native code, a C extension

        \begin{itemize}

    \lstinputlisting{my-package/my_package/math/math11.cpp}
    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This now fails on gcc < 6.0, because C++98 was still the
                  default
            \item Of course it's still valid C++, so it just needs the option
        \end{itemize}

    \lstinputlisting{my-package/setuptools-ext11.py}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ok good, so this builds... on linux
            \item MSVC doesn't understand this flag
            \item So now our script needs to detect compiler and only set the
                  flag on gcc
            \item ... until we also want to build with clang
            \item If you've ever built C++ for multiple platforms or even
                  different computers you see how this can get problematic fast
            \item Honestly, setup.py-files that do more than setup() and are
                  pure python tend to be low-effort, buggy, \emph{works on my
                  machine} solutions
            \item So now, we give up
        \end{itemize}
    }
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Building native code}
    The struggle of binary libraries

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiple compilers with different flags
        \item Compiler versions
        \item Multiple available compilers
        \item Platform-specific options
        \item Configuration-specific options, e.g. \verb|USE_BLAS|
        \item Feature detection
        \item Build and runtime dependencies
        \item Binary compatibility
    \end{itemize}

    \note{
        \emph{Read list}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The experience compiling and developing native extensions is
                  terrible
            \item Setuptools has virtually nothing to help you here, boils down
                  to manually implementing half of cmake
            \item The development story is quite bad too
            \item People end up hard-coding links to /opt/local/lib64, I can't
                  blame them
            \item Since setup.py implements build, install, test commands,
                  custom option commands are difficult or clumsy
        \end{itemize}
    }
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Developing native code}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Changes in headers aren't detected, and the module isn't
              recompiled - not great with templates
        \item Designed for distribution, not development
        \item Setuptools assumes it controls the world, so it pollutes source
              trees. Not cool when python support is a sub project
    \end{itemize}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Overall, setuptools does a poor job of tracking file ->
                  compiled object dependencies
            \item Not designing for live development of C based modules is
                  fine, they weren't aiming to build a C build system. But most
                  time is spent is development (by me), and having parallel
                  development and build systems suck
        \end{itemize}
    }

        \begin{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Enter scikit-build}
    \begin{displayquote}
        The scikit-build package is fundamentally just glue between the
        setuptools Python module and CMake
    \end{displayquote}
    - scikit-build readme

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Briefly, it automates building C++ with cmake, and automates
                  dealing with python flags, layout, options.
            \item It adresses most of the shortcomings with setuptools for
                  extensions
            \item For distribution: feature autodiscovery, compiler config,
                  dependency configuration etc
            \item For development: easy debug/release builds, file-object
                  dependency tracking, incremental builds
            \item Setuptools does what setuptools can (build python), cmake
                  does what cmake does
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{CMake}

        \item \verb|set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD)|
        \item \verb|if (MSVC)|
    \end{itemize}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Hate it or love it, cmake is pretty good at what it does
            \item It's reasonably easy to set options, deal with compiler
                  differences in cmake
            \item When you have third-party dependencies that provide
                  cmake-config or similar, you can easily get them from inside
                  the python extension with find-package

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This command is really what I mostly do during development
            \item From a clean checkout, running cmake and then this is
                  sufficient
            \item It builds the core libraries, some applications, the python
                  extension, the python library, and docs if enabled
            \item And runs the tests, across all languages
            \item It uses setup.py to run the python build system, python
                  doesn't really know that it's not the main driver. This is
                  the fat wrapper from before
            \item Now, assuming the impure python, where python is the only

\note{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is taken from dlisio
        \item If you're not familiar with cmake or custom targets, this might
              be confusing, but it makes so the python lib behaves like any
              other C++ lib from cmake's perspective
        \item Build in-place so that tests can be run directly on the source
              tree. Setuptools pollutes this directory anyway, so we're not
              really that much worse off - this is the path of least resistance
        \item Scikit-build builds for different python versions in different
              dirs, so they coexist ok
        \item setup.py tracks the python dependencies - the drawback is even
              though there's nothing to do we still must run the seutp.py file.
              This is somewhat slow, but an acceptable tradeoff

    The python packaging format is the \emph{wheel}

    \begin{block}{}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item setup.py can build with \verb|setup.py bdist_wheel|
            \item Relies on naming to distinguish package flavours
            \item Can both be pure python or include binary components
            \item pip resolves these names from the host system
        \end{itemize}

                  packages with this tag, but you can install it at your own
                  machine

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ok, so now we can reasonably easy build and develop on the
                  developer machine
            \item That's still not enough - want to test multiple versions,
                  compilers, operating systems
            \item Most of our projects \emph{are} in fact used across multiple
                  systems, but even if that wasn't the case I'd still insist on
                  it
            \item Targeting different systems improves robustness and
                  correctness - if platforms differ it's because of latent bugs
            \item Also helps the contributor experience - contributors don't
                  have to set up massive rigs, and are generally terrible at
                  running and writing tests

                  considering other providers etc
            \item We use them to test on all platforms, multiple versions
            \item Run on every pull request before merge, and all HEADs on
                  master
            \item We also use it for building and releasing packages
            \item CI is scripts + machine definition + triggers
