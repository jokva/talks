This article is written as preparation material to the *Rediscovering fire - on
designing portable multi-language libraries* talk at `NDC Techtown
<https://ndctechtown.com/talk/rediscovering-fire-on-designing-portable-multi-language-libraries/>`_,
and will largely articulate the on the lessons learned designing and
maintaining the segyio library. The topics disussed will have wider
applicability, but will point to what, how, and why things were done as they
were in segyio. In essence, this document will attempt to articulate some
insights in designing libraries for libraries.

As the name implies, these lessions aren't new. Segyio draws inspiration from
several libraries, and the relies on the experience of thousands of developers
of the past and the present.
