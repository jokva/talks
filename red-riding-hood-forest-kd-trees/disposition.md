1. hi hello
2. overview
    + on computer science
    + use this problem as base; implement & iterate on design
        - much like the story which has changed many times
    + some c++ specifics, some software dev in general
3. present problem
    + find avg of nodes within radius
    + double for loop
4. present k-d tree
    + binary tree, space partition
    + draw radius, use visual cue for termination
5. implementation 1
    + little red riding hood's bag?
    + pointers
    + iterator
    + search
6. implementation 2..n
    + iterate kdtree
7. conclusion
    + study & implement fundamental stuff once in a while
    + (seemingly) pointless changes make room for better designs
    + think about what/who you design for?
