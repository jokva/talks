# Software and source code

---

- Runnable programs are built from _source code_
- Source code is translated to or interpreted as computer instructions

---

Source code is for humans

---

Source code - hello.c

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
        puts("Hello, world!");
    }

---

Human-readable "machine instructions" - hello.s

    .LC0:
            .string "Hello, world!"
            .section        .text.startup,"ax",@progbits
            .p2align 4,,15
            .globl  main
            .type   main, @function
    main:
    .LFB11:
            .cfi_startproc
            subq    $8, %rsp
            .cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
            leaq    .LC0(%rip), %rdi
            call    puts@PLT
            xorl    %eax, %eax
            addq    $8, %rsp
            .cfi_def_cfa_offset 8
            ret
            .cfi_endproc

Machine readable instructions - hello.o

Translation to computer instructions is a _one-way process_

---

Computer instructions effectively

- Cannot be _studied_
- Cannot be _modified_
- Cannot be _adapted_

---

Conclusion

> To change a program, you need the source

# Free and open source software

---

What does it even mean?

---

Open source is a _legal_ aspect, not a technical one

---

- Controls what you can and cannot do with source code
- Definition is owned by the Open Source Initiative (OSI)

https://opensource.org/

---

>  in brief, they allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared

https://opensource.org/licenses

---

Common licences

- GNU General Public License (GPL)
    + Lesser (LGPL)
    + Affero (AGPL)
- MIT
- BSD
- Apache

---

No open source license forbid commercial use

All come with a _cost_

---

All licenses rely on copyright

---

Observation:

> Open source is a legal-only, but changes *attitude*

# Open source in O&G

---

The O&G is traditionally **very** protective and "share-unfriendly"

---

- A very conservative industry
- Applies to more than software
- This is changing slowly

---

O&G attitude:

> Everything worth using costs (a lot of) money

---

The _cost_ of software was not a big issue; high cost, high-complexity,
high-revenune business

---

Proprietary software means:

- Small players cannot afford expensive licenses
- Often difficult to upgrade or change provider
    + e.g. petrel vs openworks
- High barrier of entry for "fresh blood"
- All development comes at a (high) vendor cost, little customer control

---

Software becomes _increasingly more important_ in the industry

. . .

... which changes the need for control and ownership

---

Opinion:

> O&G is not a zero-sum game

Your gain is not my loss

---

The O&G industry today is deeply reliant on OSS

(we'll see some examples)

---

Norwegian phrase:

> Let's make each other good

# Why?

---

The battlefield has moved in the computer space

---

## Example: wells

- Before
    + Analysis was restricted to a single or handful of wells
    + Fairly manual work, assisted tools like petrel and techlog
- Now
    + Analysis or search through tens of thousands of wells
    + Automated processing
    + Statistics, ML, and predictions
    + More bespoke

---

For large-scale processing you need programmable and boring tools

---

A form of commoditization, and a level playing field

---

### Example projects

---

### I/O

- segyio
- lasio
- dlisio

---

### Maths and stats

- numpy, scipy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow, PyTorch

---

### Modelling and misc

- GemPy
- welleng, wellpathpy, welly
- devito
- madagascar, seismic unix
- opendtect

---

### For completeness

- linux
- git
- gcc and other compilers
- databases (influx, postgres, sqlite, maria etc)

---

The fight is _how well_ you can:

- Leverage your toolkit
- Experiment and understand
- Build new and novel applications

---

This requires the ability to _study_ and _modify_

---

In effect, OSS is 

- Faster
    + To adapt and modify
- Cheaper
    + Build on pre-existing work, not emulate or re-implement from scratch
    + To maintain, don't need to painfully hide source
- More available
    + Most OSS software is free (in money)
    + No trial period, no expensive licence

---

Opinion:

> The O&G industry cares neither for open source nor proprietary software

. . .

The industry cares about _value_

---

Opinion:

> (Bespoke) Software is an investment, and an open license gives higher returns

---

The ability to _modify_ and _operate_ is more valuable than the code itself

---

A community gives more value than "forcing" competitors to implement the same
features

---

If _value_ in O&G comes from how software is combined with **domain knowledge**
and **data**, not from the source code ...


. . .


... then open source will generally be more valuable

---

> Why not piggy back on your competitor?

. . .

You can, but will always be one step behind

# Projects and community

---

Common issues and questions

---

> ... but I have nothing to contribute

. . .

Sure you do!

- Questions & clarifications
- Documentation
- Bug reports
- Feature suggetions
- Translations
- Testing

---

> ... who would care about this?

. . .

You would be surprised

---

> ... it's not good enough

. . .

You would be surprised
